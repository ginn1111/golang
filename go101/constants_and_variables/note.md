##. 1. Untyped value and typed value
 - Literal value is call unamed constant of literal constant except -bool- type (this is built-in named constants)
 - Example: 
  + 1 is unamed constant (literal constant)
  + const CONSTANT = 1 is named constant also untyped named constant
 - Almost, in Go literal constants is untyped value (except bool -> is not unamed value)
