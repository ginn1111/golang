## 1. Implicit conversion
 a. If result is typed value (non-constant) -> both operands be conversion to this type, overflow do not allow. If both operands are typed value -> these types must match with result type (must explicit convert)

 b. If result is untyped value (non-constant) -> this case will express:
  + If one of both types is typed value -> the other will implicit to the one (typed value), afterthat the operation will express, allow overflow, if the result is overflow -> this will be truncated
